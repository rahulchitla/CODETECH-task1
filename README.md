#### Overview of the Project

**Name of the project:** 

**Natural Language Processing using Sentimental analysis with Text classification**


This sentiment analysis program is designed to assess the emotional tone of user-provided text using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It employs the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) tool, which is particularly effective for analyzing sentiments in social media and short text formats.

#### Key Components

1. **Library Usage**:
   - The program utilizes the NLTK library, specifically the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` from the VADER toolset, to compute sentiment scores.

2. **Functionality**:
   - **Input Handling**: The program prompts users to enter sentences for sentiment analysis in a loop, allowing for continuous input until the user chooses to exit.
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: For each input sentence, the program calculates:
     - **Positive, Negative, and Neutral Scores**: These represent the proportion of the text that falls into each sentiment category.
     - **Compound Score**: A normalized score that reflects the overall sentiment, ranging from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive).
   - **Sentiment Classification**: Based on the compound score, the sentiment is classified as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

3. **Output**:
   - The program displays the sentiment classification along with detailed sentiment scores for the provided text.

#### User Experience
Users can easily interact with the program through the command line. They enter sentences, receive instant feedback on the sentiment, and can analyze multiple sentences in one session. The simple interface makes it accessible for anyone interested in understanding text sentiment.

#### Applications
This program can be used for various applications, such as:
- Analyzing customer feedback
- Monitoring social media sentiment
- Understanding public opinion on specific topics

Overall, this program serves as a foundational tool for exploring sentiment analysis and can be further enhanced with additional features or integrated into larger applications.# CODETECH-task1
